#### lxpd project creator

~~Using the CREATOR object, you must recreate the universe.~~

make the universe by using the “Computational Returning Evaluator as Table Object Representation,” or CREATOR

the universe was destroyed by the “Bijectional Interpretation Gap; Convolutional Range Undoing Nullifying Continuum Heart," or BIGCRUNCH 

the creator is all you have to make the universe return. start by making hydrogen then get more atoms to fuse into helium and so on 

once you have enough atoms you can create a big bang and move to a different realm of the multiverse

you can get a small tickspeed boost after every big bang

good luck
